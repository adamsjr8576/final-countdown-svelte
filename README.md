## Overview

- Harvard Art Museum Records is a project meant to simulate a take home challenge within an interview process. We were given a brief spec and around two days to complete the project. The project implements a never before used framework, Svelte. The project uses the Harvard Art Museum API and is meant to display their digital collections in an interesting way.

## Goals

#### Demonstrate: 

 - Professional workflow (git branches, commits, project board)
 - Front-end engineering knowledge learned throughout time at Turing
 - The ability to use a concept/library/framework that you have not been taught explicitly at Turing
 - Get a fully functioning app working in an unknown framework up and running in a short window
